    description: "The Vauxhall/Opel Crossland X was introduced as a compact crossover SUV replacing the Meriva MPV, representing the brand's response to shifting consumer preferences from traditional people carriers toward SUV-styled vehicles. Developed under General Motors ownership but launched just as PSA Group acquired Vauxhall/Opel, the Crossland X was actually based on the PSA PF1 platform shared with the Peugeot 2008 and Citroën C3 Aircross—foreshadowing the full transition to PSA architecture that would follow. Featuring a relatively conventional crossover design with a high roofline, raised seating position, and practical proportions, the Crossland X prioritized interior space and versatility over dynamic styling or off-road pretensions. Engine options included PSA-sourced petrol and diesel units, with the petrol lineup featuring 1.2-liter three-cylinder engines in naturally aspirated (81 horsepower) or turbocharged (110 or 130 horsepower) forms, while diesel options comprised 1.5-liter four-cylinders with either 102 or 120 horsepower. Transmission choices included five and six-speed manuals or a six-speed automatic, all driving the front wheels only—all-wheel drive was not offered. The interior emphasized practicality with a flexible rear seat that could slide forward and back to prioritize either passenger or cargo space, a relatively high seating position providing good visibility, and straightforward controls. Technology features included a 7-inch or 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and available safety systems such as lane departure warning, traffic sign recognition, and forward collision alert. The Crossland X represented Vauxhall/Opel's entry into the booming small crossover segment, offering a practical alternative for families seeking more style than a traditional MPV but with similar levels of versatility."

    description: "The Vauxhall/Opel Crossland (dropping the 'X' suffix from its name) received a comprehensive facelift for 2021, adopting the brand's new 'Vizor' front end design—a blacked-out panel spanning between the headlights—that would become a signature element across the Vauxhall/Opel range. Beyond the significant front-end redesign, the updated Crossland received revised rear styling with darkened taillight surrounds, new wheel designs, and the introduction of a more dynamic-looking 'GS Line' trim level. Mechanically, the vehicle remained largely unchanged, continuing to offer the same range of PSA-sourced petrol and diesel engines, though with minor efficiency improvements to meet evolving emissions standards. Petrol options included 1.2-liter three-cylinder engines in naturally aspirated (83 horsepower) or turbocharged (110 or 130 horsepower) forms, while diesel choices comprised 1.5-liter four-cylinders with either 110 or 120 horsepower. The interior saw more modest updates with new trim options, improved technology including a standard 7-inch or optional 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and enhanced connectivity. The sliding rear seat remained a key practical feature, allowing owners to prioritize either passenger legroom or cargo capacity as needed. Under full Stellantis ownership (following the merger of PSA Group and FCA), the refreshed Crossland continued to serve as Vauxhall/Opel's entry in the competitive small crossover segment, appealing primarily to buyers seeking a practical family vehicle with a raised driving position and relatively compact exterior dimensions, though facing increased competition from newer competitors offering more distinctive styling, enhanced technology, or electrified powertrain options."
